The following fields are included in the `verification` object:  | Name | Type | Description | | ---- | ---- | ----------- | | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. | | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. | | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. | | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:  | Value | Description | | ----- | ----------- | | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. | | `not_signing_key` | The \"signing\" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. | | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. | | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. | | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. | | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. | | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. | | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. | | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. | | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. | | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. | | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. | | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.  **Signature verification object**  The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature.

If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit.

    // Returns an array of references from your Git database that match the supplied name. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`, they will be returned as an array.  When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is returned, not just `heads` and `tags`.  **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests.

If you request matching references for a branch named `feature` but the branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response can still include other matching head refs that start with the word `feature`, such as `featureA` and `featureB`.
